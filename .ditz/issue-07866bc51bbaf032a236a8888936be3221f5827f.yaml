title: Serve all frontends to the mathpad simultaneously
desc: |-
  Currently there are three different frontends being worked on. The
  original idea was to play with each idea and just go with the superior
  one. At this time however it looks like each one has it's own
  merits. I would therefore like to seriously consider finishing all
  three, and have the application serve each one under a different
  url/namespace.
