title: "Scratchpad POST #create allows arbitrary user_id"
desc: |-
  The scratchpads_controller has `:user_id` in `scratchpad_params`. This
  should probably be altered to make the controller check that the
  `user_id` is that of the currently logged in user, either that or just
  take it from the session directly and disallow that parameter
  entirely.
